### hi welcome to the routing-dev branch  
today i will be writing changes in locator.html and serving that page instead of index.html  


To build and run the web app:
* run ```node server.js```
* nice
* also it runs on localhost:8080

To tunnel localhost to the external network:
* run ```./ngrok http 8080```
* nice

(this is fine until we decide to host this thing on a domain)
